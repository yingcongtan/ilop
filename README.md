# Inverse Linear Optimization Problem (ILOP)

This repo contains materials focused on solving inverse linear optimization problems. All materials are developed jointly by Yingcong Tan, Daria Terekhov and Andrew Delong.

The [neurips2020-code](https://github.com/yingcongtan/ilop/tree/neurips2020-code) branch contains the code for reproducing the results of our NeurIPS paper "Learning Linear Programs from Optimal Decisions".

A code library may be released later in the master branch.
